alliterate
==========

Compute alliteration scores for English text

We're using:

* the CMU pronouncing dictionary (added to the repo)
* nltk for sentence segmentation and tokenizing (punkt in particular; you'll need to download the punkt package in nltk's downloader)
* Great Expectations from Project Gutenberg for sample data to work on
